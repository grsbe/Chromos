**Lair Actions** Init 20
- _**Wind!**_ Each character on the platform must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they are pushed away from the Weather Wizard all the way to the edge of the platform, where they smack their backs against the railing 1dmg
- _**Rain!**_ Each character on the platform must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d4-1 cold damage and fall prone. Remind them that they must spend half their movement to stand back up. On a successful save, they take no damage and they don't fall.
- _**Divine Fury!**_ Each character shields their eyes from a flash of light from the lightning rod and must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they become frightened of the Weather Wizard, meaning that they can't willingly move closer to him and their attack rolls are made at disadvantage. On a successful save, they are not afraid.

Once the weather wizard is defeated, the storm subsides.
