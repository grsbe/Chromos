**The Mawstone

Beneath the earth's crust, beyond where light dares to wander, lies the _Hollow Caverns_, a labyrinth of endless stone halls and echoing voids. This society, known as the Lithborn, has lived in these cold, unyielding depths for generations—children of darkness, untouched by the sun. Their pale skin glows faintly in the dim bioluminescent light of fungal groves, and their sightless eyes see only the shapes and whispers of the stone.

At the heart of their world lies _the Maw_, a gaping void of impenetrable darkness, colder and more ancient than the surrounding rock. The Maw is their lifeline, their salvation, and their curse. It demands tribute, fed through its endless depths, and in return, it grants the Lithborn energy—a strange, intangible sustenance that keeps them from succumbing to hunger and exhaustion.

The offerings vary: animals bred in the fungal caverns, precious relics infused with emotional weight, and even the people’s memories, whispered to the Maw in exchange for fleeting vitality. Yet, over the cycles, the Maw’s gifts have weakened. The energy no longer satiates as it once did, and the society has grown frail, their bodies emaciated, their strength waning. Desperation festers like mold in the damp air.

The Lithborn council gathers in the central chamber, its jagged walls lined with shimmering black stone that hums faintly—a sign the Maw is listening. The leader, _Vaelthar_, stands before the assembly, his bony frame cloaked in ceremonial moss-green robes. His voice echoes with authority, but cracks of fear run through it.

“The Maw grows silent,” he begins, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd. “Our offerings have lost their worth. The fungus wilts, the beasts grow thin, and even our most treasured relics bring only scraps of life. The Maw hungers for something greater.”

The chamber falls silent, save for the ever-present drip of water in the distance. Vaelthar lets the weight of his words settle before speaking again.

“It is time... to offer one of our own.”

A gasp ripples through the gathered Lithborn. Their faces twist in shock, in rage, in terror. _No one_ has ever dared suggest such a thing—not in their recorded history, etched onto the stone walls in glyphs of glowing ink.

“You would cast one of us into that pit?” spits _Drenna_, a healer with sharp cheekbones and a fierceness that belies her frailty. “A child of the stone? Have we sunk so low?”

Vaelthar’s gaze hardens. “Would you prefer we all perish? Our strength ebbs with each passing cycle. The Maw demands what it demands. If we deny it, it will deny us.”

“But how can we trust it?” shouts another voice, _Kaerin_, a wiry craftsman with calloused hands. “What if the Maw takes one of us and gives nothing in return? What if it... what if it lies?”

The stones hum louder, as though offended by the suggestion. A low, rumbling groan echoes through the chamber, silencing all but the most distant drips of water. The Lithborn freeze, feeling the weight of the earth press down upon them.

“It does not lie,” Vaelthar says, his voice quieter now, reverent. “The stones remember. The Maw has sustained us for generations. If we fail to act, it will consume us all, one by one, until there is nothing left but silence.”

The room erupts into chaos. Some argue for survival at all costs, others decry the sacrifice as an affront to their sacred bond with the stone.

“Who would you throw in, Vaelthar?” Drenna snarls. “Your child? Your kin? Or are you already deciding which of us is expendable?”

“I will not ask lightly,” Vaelthar replies, though his face betrays no guilt. “But we must choose. A sacrifice of flesh is the only offering we’ve yet to attempt. If the Maw rejects it, we die regardless.”

“I’ll die fighting!” shouts Kaerin, slamming his fist against a stalagmite. “Better that than feeding ourselves to that cursed hole!”

“And what will you fight, Kaerin?” Vaelthar hisses, stepping forward. “The air? The rock? Your hunger? There is no enemy to defeat here but time. If you want to live, you will listen.”

The stones hum again, louder this time, as if urging the debate forward. The hum isn’t just noise—it’s a feeling, a vibration that penetrates the body and twists the mind. Some of the Lithborn believe it is the Maw itself, whispering its will, while others think it is the stone warning them against their folly.

Amid the noise, a small voice speaks up. It belongs to _Eira_, a girl barely of age, her pale eyes wide with a strange mix of fear and resolve. “What if... it’s not about what we give, but how we give it?”

The room quiets, her words cutting through the din.

“What do you mean, child?” Vaelthar asks, his tone soft but dangerous.

Eira hesitates, then steps forward, her bare feet slapping softly against the cold stone. “We’ve only ever offered out of fear. What if the Maw wants more than just... flesh or objects? What if it wants someone to _choose_? Someone who gives themselves willingly?”

A murmur ripples through the crowd, horrified and awed. Vaelthar’s lips press into a thin line. “You suggest a volunteer.”

Eira nods. “If we choose, truly choose, maybe the Maw will see the value in that.”
The stones pulse faintly, as if in agreement—or perhaps amusement. The Lithborn fall silent once more, the weight of the decision pressing down on them like the earth above. Vaelthar’s face is unreadable as he looks from Eira to the gathering, his mind working furiously. To test her theory would be an enormous gamble. But perhaps, he thinks, it is better than his original plan.

The stones hum again, louder this time, the sound vibrating through their bones. The Maw is waiting.

The decision must be made.
The silence was suffocating, broken only by the soft, rhythmic hum of the stones. The Lithborn stood frozen, their pale, gaunt faces illuminated by the bioluminescent light, each individual contemplating the weight of Eira’s words.

Vaelthar stepped forward, his commanding presence like a shadow engulfing the room. His golden staff, a relic etched with symbols of forgotten power, struck the stone floor with a sharp _crack_.

“Very well,” he declared, his voice cutting through the tension. “If the Maw desires a willing offering, then so be it. But who among us will step forward to meet its hunger? Who among you would face the void and place your life in its hands?”

The chamber remained deathly still, save for the flicker of shifting eyes and the faint quiver of lips. No one dared to move.

Eira, the one who had dared to suggest this path, stepped closer to the edge of the chamber’s central platform, her tiny frame dwarfed by the oppressive vastness of the Hollow Caverns. “I’ll go,” she said, her voice barely audible but resolute.

“No!” Drenna cried, rushing toward her. She grabbed Eira’s arm, her grip trembling. “You’re just a child. You can’t—this isn’t your burden to bear!”

Eira looked up at her with calm, unseeing eyes that seemed to pierce through the healer’s panic. “It’s not about age or strength,” she said softly. “It’s about meaning. I’m not afraid.”

The chamber erupted into a storm of protests. Voices clashed, accusations flew, and the stones began to hum louder, vibrating underfoot with an almost imperceptible rhythm. The Maw seemed to be listening more intently now, as though savoring their despair.

Vaelthar’s staff struck the stone again, silencing the cacophony. “Enough!” he barked. His sharp gaze swept the gathered Lithborn. “If she is willing, we must honor her choice. Unless—” he paused, letting the threat hang in the air, “—one of you would prefer to take her place.”

A wave of guilt and shame washed over the crowd. The people averted their gazes, their silence a bitter confirmation. None would volunteer.
Vaelthar gestured for Eira to follow him, and the two began the solemn march toward the Maw. The other Lithborn trailed behind at a distance, their footsteps echoing faintly in the cavernous halls. As they approached the gaping void, the air grew colder, heavier. The humming of the stones deepened, resonating in their very bones.

The Maw loomed before them, its blackness devouring even the faint glow of the fungi that clung to the walls. It was alive, the void itself seeming to pulse with anticipation. The whispers began again—faint and unintelligible, but impossible to ignore. Eira stood at the edge, staring into the abyss, her face unreadable.

Vaelthar placed a hand on her shoulder, his long fingers surprisingly gentle. “You are brave, child,” he said, his voice low. “Braver than any of us. Whatever happens, you will be remembered.”

Eira nodded. “I’m ready.”
Eira stepped forward, her bare feet sliding on the icy stone. The whispering from the Maw grew louder, its strange cadence filling the chamber. The Lithborn watched in stunned silence as Eira turned to face them one last time.

“Don’t be afraid,” she said, her voice steady. “If this works, the Maw will save us. And if it doesn’t... at least we’ll know the truth.”

With that, she turned back to the void and stepped into the darkness.

For a moment, nothing happened. The whispers ceased, and the cavern was deathly quiet. Then, suddenly, the Maw erupted with light—a blinding, ethereal glow that sent waves of heat and energy surging through the chamber. The Lithborn gasped as their bodies flooded with warmth and strength, their weariness evaporating in an instant.

The stones vibrated violently, their hum turning into a deep, resonant tone that seemed to sing with power. The Lithborn fell to their knees, overwhelmed by the sensation.

And then, just as quickly as it had come, the light vanished. The Maw returned to its impenetrable blackness, and the cavern fell silent once more. The energy lingered in the air, a faint reminder of what had just occurred.
Vaelthar rose shakily to his feet, his staff clattering to the ground. He stared at the Maw, his expression a mixture of awe and dread. “It worked,” he whispered. “She... she saved us.”

But Drenna, still kneeling on the cold stone, shook her head. “Did she? Or did we doom her to something worse?”

No one answered. The Lithborn slowly dispersed, their renewed strength tainted by an unspoken guilt. The stones, ever silent now, bore witness to their retreat.

Vaelthar lingered by the Maw, staring into its depths. The faintest sound reached his ears—a whisper, distant but unmistakable.

“...thank you...”

It was Eira’s voice. But it was not a voice of peace—it was a voice of torment, echoing endlessly in the void.

Vaelthar shuddered, gripping his staff tightly. The Maw had taken its offering. But what it would demand next, no one could say.
